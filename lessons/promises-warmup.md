# Morning: Self Study Warm Up (Promises) (9:00 - 10:00)

One of the most frustrating things about browser automation is that, while the human brain can handle things like `wait a few minutes for the page to load` and `don't click until a button is on the page`, a computer isn't always so bright.

For that reason, you need to have a strong handle on handling async interactions before you dig into browser automation. This morning, take some time to refresh your memory on how Promises work!

Download the [Promise It Won't Hurt Workshop](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt) package from [Node School](https://nodeschool.io/).

```
  npm install -g promise-it-wont-hurt
```

Read through the [README](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt) for how to get started.

Feel free to get started on the exercises immediately, or, if you prefer to warm up by reading first - we recommend the following resources.

### Resources

- [The Promises Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
- [Promises in Wicked Detail](http://www.mattgreer.org/articles/promises-in-wicked-detail/)

Note: If you get stuck in the workshop, the solutions are all included in the repo if you dig far enough.

Note: If NodeSchool doesn't work on your machine, of you don't like the commandline tool - check out this [other promises workshop](https://github.com/asakusuma/promise-workshop)

Note: If you already feel solid on using promises - work on [Learn Generators](https://github.com/isRuslan/learn-generators) instead

### Wrap Up

Review the following questions and come up with some theories

1. What are the states of a promise?
2. What is the difference between a callback, a promise or a generator?
3. Why do we have Promises when we already have Callbacks?
4. Is it critical that we write Promises all the time?
5. Is jQuery using promises?
