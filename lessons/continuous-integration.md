### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will:

* Understand what continuous integration is and why it's important
* Be familiar with a typical deployment flow for agile teams
* Be able to implement CircleCI for continuous integration and deployments

## Automating the Grunt Work
As developers, we're constantly looking for ways to automate tedious tasks. We're essentially trying to put ourselves out of the job by writing scripts that will do it for us.

## Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration is a jargony buzzword that means "releasing changes fast and often". The goal of CI is to ensure stability by releasing smaller changesets at a time that are each fully tested. Many projects these days will rely on some sort of automated service to handle testing these changesets and facilitating frequent releases. 

The two most common CI services you'll hear about are [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/). Travis has been around much longer than Circle, but the jury is still out on which is better. Today we'll focus on integrating CircleCI to perform a full build of an application, test it, and deploy it to Heroku.

### Getting Started with CircleCI
1. Sign up for a CircleCI account [here](https://circleci.com/) and login with your github account.

2. On the dashboard, navigate to 'Add Projects' and you'll see a list of all the organizations you belong to (including your own). Click on your account and select a repository that you'd like to start automating with CircleCI. *(If possible, you'll want to select an application that you've deployed to Heroku, as we'll go over automating deployments later in this lesson.)*

3. Click on 'build project' and CircleCI will start creating a new build of the master branch of your application. This means it's going to automatically install any dependencies and run any tests to make sure everything is in working order.

That's it!! Easy, right? Any time you push new commits to your remote repository, CircleCI will automatically kick off a new build so you can keep an eye on the overall health and stability of your application.

### Configuring CircleCI
CircleCI automatically infers a lot of information about your application. This allows it to work straight out of the box for us when we first start following a new repo. However, as our applications get more complex, we're likely going to want to configure certain build settings to ensure a correct representation of our application's stability.

As you may have noticed, front-end repos are made up of 90% config files and 10% actual code. In order to configure CircleCI, we're going to add a `circle.yml` file to the root of our repository. Any time CircleCI runs a build, it will look for this file and follow any instructions we provide.

#### Phases of the Build Process
The yml file can define settings for various phases of the build process. The phases of a build process are:

* **machine:** adjust the behavior of the virtual machine (VM)
* **checkout:** checkout and clone code from a repository
* **dependencies:** install your projectâ€™s language-specific dependencies
* **database:** prepare a database for tests
* **compile:** compile your project
* **test:** run your tests
* **deployment:** deploy your code to your web servers

An example of how a `circle.yml` file might configure these build phases can be found in the documentation [here](https://circleci.com/docs/config-sample/).

### Automatic Deployments
CircleCI provides deployment integration with other popular services such as Heroku. Upon a successful build, we can configure CircleCI to deploy our changes to specified environments. This takes a bit more work, but the seamless automation makes it all worthwhile. 

When working with git, it's common to have a master or default branch represent your pristine production environment. We also want a staging environment where we can test out new changes and review the state of the code before it gets merged into master and sent to production. In order to maintain this staging environment, you'll want to create a 'staging' branch in your git repo. Go ahead and do that now if you don't already have one.

#### Heroku - Pipeline Setup
In Heroku, you'll want to create two different applications. A staging app and a production app. Once you've created these and configured them as needed, create a new pipeline and add them to their respective pipeline phases.

Now that we're going to integrate CircleCI, we want to configure Heroku's default 'automatic deployments'. From the pipeline, click on each application and select 'Configure Automatic Deploys...'. 

![Configure Deploys][configure-deploys]

Then select the appropriate branch to deploy from for that application (e.g. master or staging), and check the 'Wait for CI to pass' box. This will ensure that we don't deploy code that is potentially broken.

#### CircleCI - Add Deploy User
In your project settings in CircleCI, you'll see an option for 'Heroku Deployments' under the 'Continuous Integration' label. Click on that and add yourself as the deploy user. You'll need to add your Heroku API key which you can find on your [Account Settings Page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account) in Heroku. Once your API key is in place, you should be able to automatically add yourself as the deploy user.

#### Circle.yml - Configuring Deployments
The final step to linking up automatic deployments is adding an extra configuration phase to the `circle.yml` file in your repo. To set up deployments for both staging and production environments, you'll need to specify a branch and a heroku appname like so:

```yml
deployment:
  staging:
    branch: staging
    heroku:
      appname: your-staging-app-name

  production:
    branch: master
    heroku:
      appname: your-production-app-name
```

Now whenever we push to our staging or master branches, CircleCI will automatically run a build for us, and if it passes, it will deploy our app to the appropriate location.

### Adding Status Badges
You'll often see build status icons on the README files of popular open source libraries and frameworks. This is a quick and easy way to reassure users that the code is reliable. CircleCI provides a markdown snippet that we can paste directly into our README. In CircleCI, under your project settings, you'll see a 'Status Badges' link under the 'Notifications' heading in the sidebar. Copy and paste the markdown snippet provided for you and add it to your project's README.
