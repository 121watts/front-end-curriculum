  <h2>Intro to JSON Web Tokens</h2>
  <p><b>Goals:</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Understand what a JSON Web Token is and how it's used</li>
    <li>Be able to protect a server-side endpoint with a JWT</li>
    <li>Understand similarities/differences between JWTs and other authentication methods</li>
  </ol>

    <h3>What if...</h3>
    <p><i>"someone discovers a server-side endpoint used for sharing private photographs"</i></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>We can <b>protect</b> access to this endpoint by requiring <b>authentication</b> through the use of a <b>JWT</b></p>

    <h3>Characteristics of a Service Worker</h3>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4><b>Runs in the background</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>web workers are single JavaScript files, run on own thread</li>
      <li>don't block execution of any other client-side JavaScript</li>
      <li>handle time-intensive operations without locking UI</li>
      <li>service workers are a type of web worker</li>
      <li>service workers allow background processing that specifically relates to handling network requests</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4><b>Cannot interact with DOM</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>can't access the DOM tree to do any manipulations</li>
      <li>must communicate through sending messages back and forth</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4><b>Event-based</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>service worker can 'go to sleep' at any time</li>
      <li>is only woken up and utilized during events</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Service Worker Lifecycle</h3>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>1. Registration:</b> browser is aware that we have a service worker that needs to be recognized, and will kick off the installation step upon a successful registration</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>2. Installation:</b> the service worker is installed, but doesnâ€™t actually control anything on the page just yet. This is a good phase to cache assets for offline use.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>3. Activation:</b> the service worker has been installed and is activated. This is a good place for us to manage old cached assets and update the service worker.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>4. Full Page Control:</b> the service worker has been activated and now has full control over any pages that fall under its scope</p>
