title: Module 4 KickOff
---

## Learning Goals & Focus

### Server-Side Skills

Learning technologies like node and express will round out your skill set and make you a more flexible developer. Front-end developers still need a solid understanding of how to work with the back-end in order to be successful.

### Mobile Dev & Progressive Web Apps

This module will introduce some of the latest APIs and technologies that are just barely gaining traction - service workers, JSON web tokens, web sockets, etc. The goal with these isn't necessarily to walk away being able to implement them from start to finish, but rather be able to understand and discuss them at a high-level. We want you to understand the hows, whys, and whats of these technologies rather than the exact technical details. Having this knowledge and exposure will set you apart from other junior developers and prepare you for what's to come in front-end development.

### Security

JWTs, SSL & HTTPS, OAuth

### Reinforcement of Fundamentals & Real World Prep

We'll be moving away from boilerplates and frameworks in this module to get you used to building things from scratch again. We'll be providing smaller challenges throughout the module that will reinforce fundamental skills and refresh some of the previous content you learned. Many of these challenges will better prepare you for the technical interviews you'll be going on.

## Graduation Requirements

In order to graduate from Module 4, students must complete each of the following:

### Final Assessment

Students must earn a score of `3` or greater in *each* category of the final assessment rubric.

### Independent Work

* Homework (~4 assignments)
* Palette Picker
* Turing Story (5 minute presentation on your Turing experience)

### Group Work

* Build-Your-Own-Backend
* House of Vars
* Capstone Project

### Career Development

The Career Development segment is made up of a 30-day action plan where you will work with your cohort mates and instructors to prepare yourself for moving on after Turing. We will go over this in more detail during week one, but you can see a general outline [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md)
