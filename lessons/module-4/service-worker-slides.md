  <section>
    <h4><b>Runs in the background</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>service workers are a type of web worker</li>
      <li>web workers are single JavaScript files, run on own thread</li>
      <li>do not block/interfere with execution of any other client-side JavaScript</li>
      <li>allow you to do time-intensive operations without locking up the UI</li>
      <li>service workers allow background processing that specifically relates to handling network requests</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4><b>Cannot interact with DOM</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>can't access the DOM tree to do any manipulations</li>
      <li>must communicate through sending messages back and forth</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4><b>Event-based</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>service worker can 'go to sleep' at any time</li>

    <h3>Service Worker Lifecycle</h3>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>1. Registration:</b> browser is aware that we have a service worker that needs to be recognized, and will kick off the installation step upon a successful registration</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>2. Installation:</b> the service worker is installed, but doesnâ€™t actually control anything on the page just yet. This is a good phase to cache assets for offline use.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>3. Activation:</b> the service worker has been installed and is activated. This is a good place for us to manage old cached assets and update the service worker.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>4. Full Page Control:</b> the service worker has been activated and now has full control over any pages that fall under its scope</p>
