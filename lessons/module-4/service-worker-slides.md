    <h3>Service Worker Lifecycle</h3>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>1. Registration:</b> browser is aware that we have a service worker that needs to be recognized, and will kick off the installation step upon a successful registration</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>2. Installation:</b> the service worker is installed, but doesnâ€™t actually control anything on the page just yet. This is a good phase to cache assets for offline use.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>3. Activation:</b> the service worker has been installed and is activated. This is a good place for us to manage old cached assets and update the service worker.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><b>4. Full Page Control:</b> the service worker has been activated and now has full control over any pages that fall under its scope</p>
