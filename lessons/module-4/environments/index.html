          <h2><a name="Introduction">What is an Environment?</a></h2>
          <p>Environments in software development refer to the place where your code runs. The "where" in this definition is less of a physical location, and refers more to a configured setup of tools, platforms, hardware and software. Each environment typically corresponds with a specific phase of the release process.</p>

          <h2><a name="History">A Brief History</a></h2>
          <h3>Stage 0: One Environment</h3>
          <h4>Production</h4>
          <p>In the beginning, we developed our applications directly in production. This was problematic for a number of reasons. Mainly, you had to deploy your code in order to see feedback. Think of how many times you write some functionality incorrectly. Every time you push broken code to production, it's breaking the user experience for people who are currently on your application.</p>

          <h3>Stage 1: Two Environments</h3>
          <h4>(Development, Production)</h4>
          <p>To alleviate this issue, we created development environments. Development environments are intended to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>shorten the feedback loop (you can see if your code is working much more quickly without having to wait for a build or deployments)</li>
            <li>give us a low-risk place to write our code and try it out</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Development environments typically live on your laptop and allow you to configure the application in a way that makes it easiest for you to actually develop. (e.g. you might use unminified versions of libraries and packages to make debugging easier)</p>

          <p>While the development environment provided us with some answers to the problems with a single production environment, it also introduced some new ones:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Just because it works on your machine, does not mean it will work on others (e.g. you might have a node module installed locally that is a lower version of one that gets installed in production if you haven't locked down your package versions)</li>
            <li>Although rare, hardware can sometimes change how software behaves. So the system that is running your application might not be exactly the same as the one running it in production.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Stage 2: Three Environments</h3>
          <h4>(Development, Staging, Production)</h4>

          <p>So, we created another environment that we call staging. This environment is meant to execute our code in an environment as close as possible to production, without actually disrupting production. The staging environment will often be accessible only internally so that employees and team members can do a round of quality assurance before deploying to production.</p>

          <h3>Stage 3: Four Environments</h3>
          <h4>(Testing, Development, Staging, Production)</h4>

          <p>As we began to focus on automation, we developed more advanced test suites that would do their own round of quality assurance on our code before even showing it to team members. We've created testing environments to run our automated test suites that verify the integrity of our code.</p>

          <h3>Stage 4: Five Environments</h3>
          <h4>(Testing, Development, CI, Staging, Production)</h4>

          <p>There is yet another environment that is common on modern development teams: Continuous Integration. It exists to run our tests, report back with success or failure, and in some cases, take additional action.</p>

          <p>We all know to run our tests before we push, or after we merge, or before we deploy, but a continuous integration environment ensures that tests are run. We can’t forget. You can even add CI tools to your production deployment process, such that any commit that doesn’t pass its tests will be rejected.</p>
