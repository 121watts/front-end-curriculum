          <h2><a name="Introduction">Intro to OAuth</a></h2>
          <p>OAuth stands for "Open Authentication" and is an open standard for implementing token-based authentication and authorization. The term "open standard" is a little vague, but essentially describes a specification that is open to the public and free to be implemented by application developers.</p>


OAuth, which is pronounced "oh-auth," allows an end user's account information to be used by third-party services, such as Facebook, without exposing the user's password. OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the end user, providing the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared. The process for obtaining the token is called a flow.


Benefits of Oauth:
* dont have to give away your password, it wont exist in more places
* usually easier setup because you'll use a service provider


         <h3>OAuth 2.0</h3>

Like the original OAuth, OAuth 2.0 provides users with the ability to grant third-party access to web resources without sharing a password. Updated features available in OAuth 2.0 include new flows, simplified signatures and short-lived tokens with long-lived authorizations.

The biggest change in the latest version is that it’s no longer required to sign each call with a keyed hash. The most common implementations of OAuth use one or both of these tokens instead:

access token: sent like an API key, it allows the application to access a user’s data; optionally, access tokens can expire.
refresh token: optionally part of an OAuth flow, refresh tokens retrieve a new access token if they have expired.

          <h2><a name="TokenBasedAuth">Token-Based Auth</a></h2>
          <p>We previously learned about <a href="#">JSON Web Tokens</a>, and described the general flow of receiving a token to identify a user, and using that token to authorize future requests. The initial phase of this process - generating a token to identify a user - is considered the authentication "handshake". You'll hear this term handshake used frequently to describe an authentication mechanism. It simply means that a client (in our case, the browser), is telling a server:</p>
          <blockquote>"Hi, nice to meet you, I am Bob Loblaw and I would like for you to trust me. Here are a couple facts about myself."</blockquote>
          <p>And the server looks Bob Loblaw up and down, writes down all of his information and says:</p>
          <blockquote>"Ok, Bob Loblaw. I trust you on one condition: you must provide me this secret password every time we do business."</blockquote>
          <p>And the server gives Bob a token that has encoded all of Bob's information and permission levels. Bob can now use this token as a "hall pass" to send and receive data from the server.</p>
          <p>This token-based authentication flow is also what's used in OAuth implementations. In fact, some OAuth service providers like <a href="">Auth0</a> use JSON Web Tokens in their implementation.</p>

            <p>We've now learned about a couple different authentication mechanisms for working with APIs. Take a moment to read the following blog post on the differences between each of them and their best use cases:</p>

          <h2><a name="AuthvsAuth">Authentication vs. Authorization</a></h2>
          <p>You'll often hear the two words authentication and authorization used interchangeably - but they actually have two very different meanings. The process of <b>authentication</b> answers the question "Who are you?", while <b>authorization</b> answers the question: "What are you allowed to do?".</p>
          <p>For example, I build a contacts application called FooBar that manages all of my contacts on various social accounts. I first authenticate my application with Google, telling them that I am FooBar. I then authorize my application to give it permissions for reading and writing changes to my Google contacts list.</p>
          <p>Remember that OAuth stands for "Open Authentication". While the OAuth flow handles authorization and permissions as well, its main emphasis is on the authentication process, where you can essentially "log in" to a third-party without giving away your credentials.</p>
