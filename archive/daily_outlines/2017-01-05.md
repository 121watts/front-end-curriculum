### Project Work Time (9:00 - 4:00)

We had project work time scheduled for tomorrow's instructional session. So, we're going to flip today and tomorrow. Classes originally on the calendar for today will happen tomorrow and today, you'll have some time to work on your projects.

Some unsolicited thoughts. You're group is likely split up between a few locations right now. This is good. Use this as an excuse to practice your workflow.

- Divide tasks up rather than tackling them as a group.
- Open issues detailing what needs to be done.
- Open up pull requests documenting your solution or implementation.
- Do thorough code review.
- Tag Steve, Alex, and Brittany if you come to an impasse or want an opinion on a given piece of code. (Pro tip: Yea, you can totally tag us in your massive, 10 file PR, but you can also tag us in a particular line comment if you want our laser-focused attention.)
