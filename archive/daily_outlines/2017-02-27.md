Check out the [Final Countdown Doc](https://gist.github.com/rrgayhart/4afe1b14f99b173f75fab25bd6aca949)!

## Unit Testing for Champions (9am to 11:45? 10:00? Time is our oyster, really)

Come and learn the missing piece of Unit Testing. It's all going to make sense forever now.

## Final Assessment ReWork Time && Make Up WhiteBoarding

If you didn't have a whiteboard challenge last week, let us know and we'll get you scheduled.

Otherwise, wrap up your final assessment testing.

Otherwise, work on your capstones.

I made a diagram
