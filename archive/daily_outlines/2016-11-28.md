### Module 4 Kickoff (9:00 - 10:00)

Join Steve and Alex in our old home to kick off the final module. We'll discuss the point system, balancing the job search with class work and some of the other expectations in the module.

### Reintroduction to Node.js (10:00 - 10:50)

Stick around with Steve to revisit Node.js as we get our server-side sea legs. Questions welcomed and expected. Seriousâ€”don't let me down.

### Introduction to Express (11:00 - 12:00)

Alex will go a little deeper into the inner workings of Express. Don't worry he'll go much deeper tomorrow.

### Jet Fuel Kickoff and Project Work Time (1:00 - 4:00)

### Getting Settled in Module 3 (9:30 - 10:00)

Today's Location: Conference Room
Building across the street from the bank, building 1401. 3rd floor, left out of the elevator, next right, door on the left labeled "Conference Room"

Get together with the Mod-3 Dream Team to talk about what to expect this module, meet our new all-star instructor Nathanial, and share stories about our time off. Taylor will probably dance.

### React Router 2.0 (10:00 - 11:00)

Although React Router 4.0 is the new big deal, it's still relatively unstable and is quite different from the version you will be using in your first project. Taylor will introduce you to React Router 2.0.

### Promises Revisited (11:00 - 12:00)

Steve stops in to dig deeper into Promises and will probably share additional words of wisdom about the module.

### Unit Testing React Workshop (1:00 - 4:00)

Join Brenna and revisit testing React using Jest and Enzyme. You'll kick off the afternoon together and then break off to finish the workshop independently.
