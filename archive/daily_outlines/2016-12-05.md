### Introduction to Ember (9:00 - 12:00)

Steve introduces our next JavaScript framework. Please have the following downloaded and installed _before_ class starts.

- [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/): `npm install -g ember-cli`
- [Bower](https://bower.io/): `npm install -g bower`
- [Ember Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi?hl=en)

We'll be building another little grocery list. You'll probably also want this [awesome style sheet](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/7c24cc786d6f78f4ef3b7498fd3589e9).

Some things to think about:

- Yea, we're learning some Ember and that's neat, but what are some patterns that you could apply to other projects/applications you've worked on?
- React tends to mix in mark-up with functionality, while Ember keeps it separate. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
