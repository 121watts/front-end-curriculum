## Abstract

So far we've been building a lot of projects from scratch. While this is a great way to learn, it doesn't quite prepare you for the horror that is jumping into a pre-existing codebase full of bugs, legacy code and unfamiliar frameworks and libraries. In this project, we'll learn how to navigate and contribute to someone else's codebase by implementing features, refactoring old code, and fixing bugs: all without breaking anything. Be careful what you touch! The slightest change could bring the whole app down.
