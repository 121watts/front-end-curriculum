# Front End Curriculum

This is a small static Jekyll site that contains the front end program's lessons and projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In order to get this repo up and running you will need to have Ruby 2.4.1 installed and active. You will also need the `bundler` and `jekyll` gems installed.

```
gem install bundler
gem install jekyll
```

### Installing

Once you have Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll installed, you can install dependencies by running:

```
bundle
```

And after all dependencies are installed, you can run the following to start your local server on port 4000:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
